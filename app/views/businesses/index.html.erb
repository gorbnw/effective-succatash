    <h2>We're happy to see you - yes you!</h2>
    <p>Welcome to FeelFree, where we believe everyone should feel comfortable to always be their authentic self.</p>
    <p>Sharing critical experiences through word of mouth can only spread so far. We want to help celebrate businesses that provide safe and inclusive spaces, and to encourage accountability for those that don’t.</p>
    <p>We offer a platform for patrons to search for businesses and leave testimonials based on their unique experience. We noticed there were several ratings sites available but none that focus on discussing the environment that a business cultivates.</p>
    <p>Have you ever been out and about and felt uncomfortable simply for being yourself? Has a business ever made you feel welcome to be exactly you without any reservations? We want to hear all about it! We welcome you to browse the site, read and write testimonials, and let others know when their voices are heard! Remember, when you're here you're participating in a movement to make the world a kinder place.</p>

    <h2>At FeelFree, it is our mission...</h2>
    <p>to provide a platform for people to give positive and constructive feedback. We aim to focus on personal safety and, as we realize that this can delve into some gray areas, we ultimately trust our users to define what a 'safe' or 'unsafe' environment means to them. We assert that no voice should be left unheard and wholeheartedly believe that each person’s experience is as valid as the next. Please join us in making our public spaces kinder and more accessible for all.</p>
